Lifestyle Medicine & Gospel Medical Evangelism Knowledge Platform

1. Product Overview
Product Name (Working)

Lifestyle Medicine & Gospel Medical Evangelism (LM–GME) Knowledge Platform

Product Type

Web-based clinical knowledge and decision-support system

Product Vision

To build a living, evidence-based, spiritually integrated knowledge platform that equips healthcare and ministry teams to deliver whole-person care, combining lifestyle medicine, clinical research, and spiritual care in a single, structured system.

Value Proposition

A centralized, auditable, and continually improving reference system—similar in concept to UpToDate—focused on lifestyle-first interventions and Gospel Medical Evangelism.

2. Problem Statement
Current State

Lifestyle Medicine and GME content exists primarily in static Word/PDF documents

Updating evidence requires manual document revision

Difficult to:

Search across conditions

Reuse interventions

Track evidence strength

Maintain consistency across teams and regions

Spiritual care content is often siloed from clinical guidance

Impact

Fragmented knowledge

Reduced confidence in guidance

Limited scalability

High maintenance burden

3. Goals & Objectives
Primary Goals

Transform static treatment guides into structured, relational knowledge

Support evidence-based lifestyle medicine

Integrate Scripture and spiritual care as first-class content

Enable multidisciplinary team usage

Ensure auditability, accountability, and governance

Non-Goals

Not an EHR

Not a patient record system

No PHI storage

No billing or scheduling

4. Target Users
Primary Users

Physicians

Lifestyle Medicine practitioners

Culinary medicine coaches

Fitness specialists

Health coaches

Hydrotherapists

Spiritual care providers

Pastors and ministry leaders

Secondary Users

Medical missionaries

Students and trainees

Researchers

Editors and reviewers
